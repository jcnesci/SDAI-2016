# SDAI-2016

Video art project for the San Diego Art Institute. SDAI asked Soso/me to make something to project in their lobby during an exhibition.

## Concept

Inspired by [glitch art](https://phillipstearns.wordpress.com/glitch-art-resources/) and a prescient, seminal short story about technology in our lives, ["The Machine Stops"](http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/prajlich/forster.html).

A Processing script takes multiple video and image assets and produces a two videos, glitched them according to a narrative inspired by The Machine Stops. The 2 videos represent the 2 main characters in the story, Vashti and her son Kuno, using source video of screencaptures of 2 users each using a popular modern OS (Mac and Linux). The videos are projected onto 2 walls forming a corner of the SDAI lobby, in order to contrast each other and the points of view of their characters.

## Example

Here's a little taste of 1 of the 2 final 15 minute videos.
